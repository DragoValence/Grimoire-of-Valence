        <description>
            <p>Fast but precise, lethal yet elegant, the Blade dancer utilizes quick movements and a specialized weapon for a spectacle of flurrying attacks while dodging effortlessly through combat. Watching one is awe inspiring, fighting one is unrelenting</p>
            <h4>GRACEFUL FIGHTERS</h4>
            <p>Blade dancers are a blur of blades and magic woven into a graceful display of talent and power. Each Blade Dancer fights differently with unique styles and movements, their weapons taking on different forms as they’re a reflection of its wielder's soul. </p>
            <h4>TRAINED DANCERS</h4>
            <p>Blade dancers are very vibrant souls as their fighting style would depict, the more emotional the soul, the more potent their magic might become,the highs and lows of emotions can be the difference between a violent blitz of blood soaked steel, to a calm and defensive stance designed to disarm. Blade dancers are extremely adaptable and suited for turning their emotions, even the most gruesome ones into spectacular displays of bladesmanship</p>
            <h4>Creating a Blade Dancer</h4>
